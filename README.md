# Data Visualisation with Python libraries: matplotlib, seaborn, holoviews

In this repository, I have applied an exploratory data visualization script designed to analyze and visualize customer data across various retail outlets. It leverages Python libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, and holoviews to perform data analysis, generate visualizations, and explore correlations between different data features.

Process:

1. Setup <br>
2. Data Import <br>
3. Data Exploration and Summarization <br>
4. Visualizations <br>
   Bar Chart for Total Customers by Outlets <br>
   Segmenting Customers  <br>
   Heatmap for Correlation <br>
   Line Chart for Time Series <br>
   Box Plots <br>
   Radar Charts <br>
   Comparative Bar Chart <br>
   Interactive Plots <br>
